The Microsoft Windows Script Host (originally called Windows Scripting Host,
but renamed for the second release) is distributed and installed by default on
Windows 98 and later versions of Microsoft Windows. It is also installed if
Internet Explorer 5 (or a later version) is installed. It provides scripting
capabilities comparable to batch files, but with a greater range of supported
features. Beginning with Windows 2000, the Windows Script Host became available
for use with user login scripts.

It is language-independent in the sense that it can make use of different Active
Scripting language engines. By default it interprets and runs plain-text JScript
(.JS and .JSE files) and VBScript (.VBS and .VBE files). Users can install
different scripting engines to enable them to script in other languages, for
instance Perl. The language independent filename extension WSF can also be used.
The advantage of the Windows Script File (.WSF) is that it allows the user to
use a combination of scripting languages within a single file.
